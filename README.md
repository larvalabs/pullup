PullUp
======
A website you join via pull request. See it live at http://pullup.herokuapp.com

What would it be like if every user of a site had contributed some code? Let's find out! Right now the site is little more
than a terrible Hacker News type thing, but let's see if it can grow into something more.

How to join
-----------

Summary:
- Fork and set up project for development (see below)
- Add a feature, fix a bug, improve the design, etc.
- Submit a pull request! When we merge your changes, you'll be allowed to log in. We use the github API to track contributors, who get exclusive access.

Development Setup
---------------

Prerequisites: node and mongo.

```bash
# Fetch only the latest commits.
git clone git@github.com:larvalabs/pullup.git

cd pullup

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

node app.js
```

# Pre-reqs for local login
To log in to your development instance you'll need to create a GitHub application and set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENTID='CLIENTID'
export GITHUB_SECRET='SECRET'
```
