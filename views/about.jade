    h3 FAQ
    dl.faq
        dt What does the site do?
        dd Not much yet! So far it’s just a Hacker News clone, but it would be great if it ended up growing into something else.
        dt How exactly do I join?
        dd Add a feature, fix a bug, improve the design, whatever you like. Find the details on the <a href="/signup">signup page</a>.
        dt What feature should I add?
        dd Right now we could use things like commenting, voting, bookmarklet and so on. If you’re ambitious maybe private messaging? Almost anything, as even this page sucks, for example.
        dt What technology is the site using?
        dd
            a(href="http://nodejs.org/") NodeJS
            | ,#{' '}
            a(href="http://expressjs.com/") Express
            | , and#{' '}
            a(href="http://www.mongodb.org/") Mongo
            | . We figured everybody who's worked on a website knows JavaScript, so it’d be a good universal language for the site.
        dt Why did you make this?
        dd We wondered what a site would be like where every user had contributed some code. It should mean no spam, no content marketing, and hopefully a stronger feeling of community.

script(type='text/javascript').
    !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');
