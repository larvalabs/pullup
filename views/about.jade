    dl.faq
        dt What does the site do?
        dd Not much yet! So far it’s just a terrible and featureless clone of Hacker News, but it would be great if it ended up growing into something else.
        dt How exactly do I join?
        dd Add a feature, fix a bug, improve the design, whatever you like. See more details <a href="/signup">over here</a>.
        dt What feature should I add?
        dd Right now we could use things like commenting, voting, bookmarklet and so on. If you’re ambitious maybe private messaging? Almost anything, as even this page sucks, for example.
        dt What technology is the site using?
        dd
            a(href="http://nodejs.org/") NodeJS
            | ,#{' '}
            a(href="http://expressjs.com/") Express
            | , and#{' '}
            a(href="http://www.mongodb.org/") Mongo
            | . We figured JavaScript is very popular these days, so it’d be a good choice for the site.
        dt Why did you make this?
        dd We wondered what a site would be like where every user had contributed some code. It should mean no spam, no content marketing, and hopefully a stronger feeling of community.
