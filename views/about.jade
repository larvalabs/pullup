    dl.faq
        dt What does the site do?
        dd Not much yet! So far it’s just a Hacker News clone, but it would be great if it ended up growing into something else.
        dt How exactly do I join?
        dd Add a feature, fix a bug, improve the design, whatever you like. Find the details on the <a href="/signup">signup page</a>.
        dt What feature should I add?
        dd Almost anything! If you don't know where to start, check out the open issues labeled <a href='https://github.com/larvalabs/pullup/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner'>beginner</a>.
        dt What technology is the site using?
        dd
            a(href="http://nodejs.org/") NodeJS
            | ,#{' '}
            a(href="http://expressjs.com/") Express
            | , and#{' '}
            a(href="http://www.mongodb.org/") Mongo
            | . We figured everybody who's worked on a website knows JavaScript, so it’d be a good universal language for the site.
        dt Why did you make this?
        dd We wondered what a site would be like where every user had contributed some code. It should mean no spam, no content marketing, and hopefully a stronger feeling of community.
